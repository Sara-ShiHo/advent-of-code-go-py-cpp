# advent-of-code-go-py-cpp
implement advent of code problems in golang, python, and C++

## Summary

### Day 01
 - Goal: Find elements in array which sum to 2020.
 - Implementation: Find the intersection of the set of numbers and the set of numbers subtracted from 2020.

### Day 02
 - Goal: Given parameters, determine whether a string password is valid.
 - Implementation: Sum the output of a "parsing" function which return 1 if input is valid.

### Day 03
 - Goal: Diagonally parse through 2D array to find "tree" characters.
 - Implementation: Reset the left-to-right search position by using a modular function.

### Day 04
 - Goal: Given items, determine whether they meet various ID requirements.
 - Implementation: Put items into a dictionary/map structure; evaluate each key-pair value.

### Day 05
 - Goal: Binary space partitioning seat positions; find which seat is unoccupied.
 - Implementation: Sort the occupied seat numbers, find the missing, nonconsecutive seat number. C++ note: integer division yields the integer sfloor of the output (not rounded or converted to float)
